# What is <img height="25" width="25" src="https://github.com/ariehariady/dispatchapy/blob/main/statics/favicon.png" alt="Dispatchapy Logo" width="80"> Dispatchapy?

**Dispatchapy** is a resilient, high-availability API dispatch gateway. It is designed to be a single, reliable entry point for sending notifications and webhooks through multiple providers. With features like automatic failover, health checks, and a full UI for configuration, it ensures your critical communications are always delivered.

### Key Features

-   ‚úÖ **High Availability:** Automatically fails over to healthy resources in a user-defined sequence.
-   ü©∫ **Health Checks:** Actively monitors the status of all resources and provides a detailed history.
-   üìß **Failure Notifications:** Sends email alerts or triggers webhooks when a resource goes down.
-   üîß **Dynamic Configuration:** Manage Resources, Endpoints, Clients, and Rules through a clean web interface.
-   üîí **Secure:** All API endpoints are protected by client-specific authentication tokens.
-   üß™ **Development Mode:** A powerful mode for overriding incoming data for testing and development without changing client code.
-   üê≥ **Containerized:** Easy to deploy and run anywhere with a simple `docker-compose up`.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker Compose

This is the recommended way to run Dispatchapy for both development and production.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ariehariady/dispatchapy.git
    cd dispatchapy
    ```

2.  **Configure the Password:**
    Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and change the `GATEWAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a strong, secret password.

3.  **Build and Run:**
    Run the following command from the project's root directory. This will build the Docker image and start the container in the background.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the Gateway:**
    The application is now running!
    - **UI:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
    - **Default Password:** The password you set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## üìñ Functional Documentation

Dispatchapy is configured entirely through its web interface. Here are the core concepts:

### 1. Resources
A **Resource** is a destination API endpoint that you want to send data to. Each resource has:
- **Health Checks:** The gateway periodically sends a test `POST` request to the resource's endpoint using the "Health Check Values" you define. If the check fails, the resource is marked as "DOWN".
- **Notifications:** You can configure email and webhook notifications to be triggered when a resource's health status changes from UP to DOWN.

### 2. Endpoints
An **Endpoint** is a custom API route that you create on the gateway (e.g., `/api/send_alert`). This is the URL that your own applications will call. An endpoint is configured with:
- **Associated Resources:** A prioritised, ordered list of resources to be used for failover. The worker will always try the first healthy resource in the sequence.
- **Required Incoming Parameters:** The list of fields that a client application must provide in its JSON payload (e.g., `phone`, `message`).
- **Development Mode:** A toggle that enables special testing rules.

### 3. Clients & Authentication
Every call to a Dispatchapy endpoint must be authenticated.
- **Clients:** You can create multiple clients for each endpoint. Each client is given a unique, secret `X-API-Token`.
- **Authentication:** The client application must include its token in the `X-API-Token` HTTP header with every request.

### 4. Rules
The "Rules" page is where you define how data is transformed. It has two main parts:
- **Parameter Mapping:** This translates the data from your client's payload into the format required by a specific resource. For example, you can map an incoming `phone` field to the `recipient_number` field that your provider expects.
- **Development Rules:** When "Dev Mode" is on, these rules can override incoming data for testing. You can set default overrides (e.g., always send to a test phone number) or conditional overrides (e.g., if `scope` is "testing", send to a test number).

### 5. Task Lifecycle
- **Pending:** A task is created in this state. The worker will pick it up when a healthy resource is available.
- **Processing:** A worker has locked the task and is attempting to send it.
- **Success:** The notification was successfully sent.
- **Failed:** The task failed on all available resources for the maximum number of configured retries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Documentation

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
- **UI:** Jinja2 templates with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

### Architecture
Dispatchapy runs on two main background processes (workers):
1.  **Task Execution Worker (`worker_loop`):** This is a high-frequency worker that constantly polls the database for `pending` tasks. It finds the next healthy resource in an endpoint's failover sequence and attempts to execute the task. It handles all retry and failover logic.
2.  **Health Check Worker (`resource_health_check_loop`):** This is a lower-frequency worker that periodically checks the status of all active resources. It is responsible for marking resources as `UP` or `DOWN` and triggering failure notifications.

## üí° Potential Usage

While I developed this originally for managing notification services for my projects, Dispatchapy is a generic API dispatcher and can be used to add resilience and a unified interface to any API that accepts a `POST` request.

- **SMS Gateways:** Twilio, Vonage, etc.
- **Transactional Email Services:** SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark.
- **Push Notification Services:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), OneSignal.
- **Internal Webhooks:** Sending reliable, retried notifications between your own microservices.
- **Team Chat Notifications:** Sending alerts to Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams.
- **IoT (Internet of Things):** Sending commands to smart devices.
